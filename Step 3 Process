Here's a breakdown of the steps and code you're working with:

### **Data Exploration**
1. **`df.shape`**: This returns the dimensions of the DataFrame, showing the number of rows (940) and columns (15). This provides an initial sense of the dataset's size.
   
2. **`df.columns`**: This lists the column names in the dataset, helping to understand the structure of the data.
   
3. **`df.head(8)`**: Displays the first 8 rows of the dataset, giving a snapshot of what the data looks like.

   - This dataset tracks daily activity from Fitbit users, with columns like `Id` (unique identifier), `ActivityDate`, and metrics like `TotalSteps`, `TotalDistance`, `Calories`, and various activity levels.

### **Data Cleaning**
1. **`df.dtypes`**: Lists the data types of each column. This is useful to ensure that the columns have appropriate types for the data they store.
   - For example, `Id` is initially an `int64` but should be an `object` because it's an identifier.
   - `ActivityDate` is an `object` but should be a date format for easier time-based analysis.

2. **Data Type Conversion**:
   - **`df['Id'] = df['Id'].astype(str)`**: Converts the `Id` column from `int64` to a string (`object`), since it's an identifier and doesn't need to be used for mathematical operations.
   - **`df['ActivityDate'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ActivityDate'],format="%m/%d/%Y")`**: Converts the `ActivityDate` column from a string to a `datetime64` format for better date manipulation.

3. **Checking and Removing Redundant Columns**:
   - The dataset contains different distance-related columns, like `TotalDistance` and `TrackerDistance`. The code checks if the sum of the individual activity distances (`VeryActiveDistance`, `ModeratelyActiveDistance`, `LightActiveDistance`, `SedentaryActiveDistance`) matches the `TotalDistance`.
   - If these columns are found redundant, one can be removed.

4. **Summing Activity Minutes**:
   - **`df['TotalMinutes'] = df['VeryActiveMinutes'] + df['FairlyActiveMinutes'] + df['LightlyActiveMinutes'] + df['SedentaryMinutes']`**: Adds up the activity minutes to get a total of all activity per day.

5. **Renaming Columns**:
   - **`df.columns = df.columns.str.lower()`**: Converts all column names to lowercase for consistency.
   - **`df.rename()`**: Renames specific columns to make them more readable, for example, renaming `activitydate` to `activity_date`.

6. **Day of Week Creation**:
   - **`df['day_of_week'] = df['activity_date'].dt.day_name()`**: Creates a new column that adds the name of the day for each activity date.
   - **`df['n_day_of_week'] = df['activity_date'].dt.weekday`**: Adds a column for the numeric representation of the weekday (0 for Monday, 6 for Sunday).

7. **Null and Duplicate Checks**:
   - **`df.isna().sum()`**: Checks for any missing values in the dataset.
   - **`df.duplicated().sum()`**: Checks for duplicate rows in the dataset.

### **Subsetting Data**
- The code then subsets the dataset to keep only the columns relevant for the analysis. For instance, distance-related columns (`tracker_distance`, `logged_activities_distance`) may be dropped if found redundant.

### **Creating Categories**
1. **Grouping by User ID**:
   - **`id_grp = df.groupby(['id'])`**: Groups the data by the `id` column to calculate per-user statistics.

2. **Classifying Users by Activity Level**:
   - The code calculates the average daily steps for each user (`id_avg_step = id_grp['total_steps'].mean()`) and classifies them into three categories:
     - Sedentary (less than 6,000 daily steps)
     - Active (6,000 to 12,000 daily steps)
     - Very Active (more than 12,000 daily steps)
   
   - **`np.select(conditions, values)`**: This function is used to assign users to one of these three categories based on the conditions.

3. **Adding a New Column**:
   - **`df['activity_level']`**: This column categorizes each user based on their average daily steps (using a list comprehension to match the user ID with their corresponding activity level).

This code pipeline effectively cleans, explores, and transforms the Fitbit dataset, preparing it for further analysis, like understanding user behavior or studying activity patterns over time.
