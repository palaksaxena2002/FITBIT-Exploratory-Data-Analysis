Rewards and reminds
Bellabeat can integrate functions within the bellabeat app or other products, such as rewards or incentives, and reminds to encourage their users to hit certain marks These marks could be achieving the minimum amount of 7 500 steps per day, certain calorie burning for people who want to lose weight, or the 8 hour sleep pattern Certain rewards could be showing a leaderboard of top users who have reached and maintained the minimum steps a day for longer, virtual medals or prizes, such as discounts or offers For the reminds part, Bellabeat could send notifications to their users when they are lagging behind in such goals, and also it could offer recomendations to their users to help them with their sleep, or achieving their goals
